## Factor Analysis

From factor analysis, we have decided to keep `r factors_selected` factors, which can cover `r round(Variance_Explained_Table_copy[factors_selected, "cumulative percentage of variance"], 2)`% of the variance in the original dataset, from the survey's 20 different needs.

---

## Factors

Using factor loadings, we can call our 10 factors as following:

1. Pre and post-ordering Processes
2. Pricing
3. Services and operations
4. Sustainability
5. Growth
6. Quality
7. Broad portfolio
8. Business services
9. Account management
10. Coloring

## Cluster Analysis

We can create 3 segments using the scores from factor analysis and they are as following :

1. Matured clients

2. Entry level clients

3. Support oriented and cash rich clients

---

## Matured clients

These customers are mature businesses and there are total `r nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==1,])` clients (`r round(100*nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==1,])/nrow(ProjectData), 2)`% of whole dataset). They needs their supplier to have an efficient and reliable ordering process, delivery & inventory management, and formula based or fixed material price. This shows that they are more matured and process based clients and they want certainty and predictability in their cost of ordering. This is strengthened more by having scores of `r round(100*(cluster_profile_ratios["MAXDIFF: Credit limit. financing and payment terms",1]-1),2)` percent higher than population average in needs of credit limit, financing and payment terms, which is the highest among 3 segments.

Since they are already matured, clients from this segment do not need collaboration for growth, global service and operations, and business services. They have specific kind of material they require and they do not need their supplier to have broad material portfolio.

---

## Entry level clients

These customers are entry level business and they are total `r nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==2,])` clients (`r round(100*nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==2,])/nrow(ProjectData), 2)`% of whole dataset). Since they are entry level businesses, they are willing to collaborate for growth and they needs their supplier support towards their sustainable goals. Being entry level businesses, they also want dedicated account manager relationship and they need their supplier to have a strong business services and global service and operations. 

Strangely, they are not very much interested in material coloring solutions and broad material portfolio. This may be because they are entry level businesses and they still do not need sophisticated and advanced services. Most importantly, they paid premium in the past more than population average and therefore, they are valuable customers. However, they have highest average score in "willing to change supplier" with `r round(cluster_profile_ratios["Willing to Changing suppliers",2],2)` among all segments. So, we need to pay more attention to this segments as this segment has a lot of room to improve and can grow the business.

## Support oriented and cash rich clients

These customers are support oriented and cash rich clients and they are total `r nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==3,])` clients (`r round(100*nrow(ProjectData[ProjectData[,"Cluster_Membership"]==3,])/nrow(ProjectData), 2)`% of whole dataset). They rate highly generally on support related needs such as material selection support, processing support, and application development support. Interestingly, they need supplier with significantly broad material portfolio and material coloring solutions because, possibly, their need of products are diversed. Therefore, they rate less for fixed material price. As support oriented clients, they are more interested in collaboration during innovation process than collaboration for growth.

They definitely are cash rish clients. They rate generally lower than population average for cost related needs such as total system cost reduction and formula based or fixed material price. They do not need credit limit, financing and payment terms. This segment of clients paid premium the most among all the segments and least willing to change supplier.
