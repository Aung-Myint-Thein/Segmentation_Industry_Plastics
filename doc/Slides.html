  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>From factor analysis, we have decided to keep 10 factors, which can cover 78.44% of the variance in the original dataset, from the survey&#39;s 20 different needs.</p>

    <h2>Segments</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>We can create 3 segments and they are as following :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Matured clients</p></li>
<li><p>Entry level clients</p></li>
<li><p>Support oriented and cash rich clients</p></li>
</ol>

<slide class="" id="slide-4" style="background:;">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>Matured clients</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>These customers are mature businesses and there are total 315 clients (17.75% of whole dataset). They needs their supplier to have an efficient and reliable ordering process, delivery &amp; inventory management, and formula based or fixed material price. This shows that they are more matured and process based clients and they want certainty and predictability in their cost. This is strengthened more by having 18.7 percent higher than population average in needs of credit limit, financing and payment terms and the highest among 3 segments.</p>

<p>Since they are already matured, clients from this segment do not care and need so much of collaboration for growth, global service and operations, and business services. They know/have specific kind of material they require and they do not need their supplier to have broad material portfolio.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-5" style="background:;">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>Segment B</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>These customers are entry level business and they are total 798 clients (44.96% of whole dataset). Since they are entry level businesses, they are willing to collaborate for growth (95.99% higher than population average) and they needs their supplier support towards their sustainabile goals (17.67% higher than population average). Being an entry level businesses, they also want dedicated account manager relationship (16.77% higher than population average) and they need their supplier to have a strong business services (91.12% higher than population average) and global service and operations (63.18% higher than population average). </p>

<p>Strangely, they are not very much interested in material coloring solutions (34.7% lower than population average) and broad material portfolio (44.78% lower than population average). This may be because they are entry level businesses and they still do not need sophisticated and advanced services.</p>

<p>Most importantly, they paid premium in the past (10.59% higher than population average) and therefore, they are valuable customers. However, they have highest average score in &quot;willing to change supplier&quot; with 1.02 among all segments. So, we need to pay more attention to this segments as this segment has a lot of room to improve and can grow the business and our subsequent analysis will be based on this segment.</p>

  <hgroup>
    <h2>Segment C</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>These customers are support oriented and cash rich clients and they are total 662 clients (37.3% of whole dataset). They rate highly generally on support related questions such as material selection support (26.34% higher than population average), processing support (12.55% higher than population average), and application development support (14.44% higher than population average). Interestingly, they need supplier with significantly broad material portfolio (165.46% higher than population average) and material coloring solutions (137.05% higher than population average). May be because their need of products are diversed and therefore, they rate less for fixed material price (check below). As support oriented clients, they are more interested to collaborate during innovation process (11.02% higher than population average) than collaboration for growth (21.06% lower than population average). </p>

<p>They definitely are cash rish clients. They rate generally lower than population average for cost related needs such as total system cost reduction (27.55% lower than population average) and formula based or fixed material price (22.34% lower than population average). They do not need credit limit, financing and payment terms (29.28% lower than population average). This segment of clients paid premium the most among all the segments (11.7% higher than population average) and least willing to change supplier (1.96% lower than population average).</p>
